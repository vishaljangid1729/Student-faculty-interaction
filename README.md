# Student-faculty-interaction

## Problem statement
As we are in college of National importance. It is very necessary to have a very good interaction between students and faculties members of our college. Many students are interested in working on projects and research work going on in our campus with facilities
members. But they don't have information about their project and their area of research.

## Solution
I tried to solve this problem by making a web application which may increase the interaction
between students and faculties. Many faculties members don't have time to update their
profile and inform the students for their area of research. So, they can authorize some
students or PhD students to post their posts. Only authorized students can put information
about the faculty.

## Features of web app:
### For Faculties members:-
First faculties members need to register on the web as faculty by submitting a simple form.
After login they have many options:
- Create a post by self to give infomation.
- Authorized someone who can create a post for his/her.
- Unauthorize authorized user.
- See all the activities which are going on in our campus.
### For Students:-
First students need to register on the web as student by submitting a simple form. After login
they have many options:
- Create a post by self to give information.
- Create a post for faculty who authorized him/her.
- See all the activities which are going on in our campus.
